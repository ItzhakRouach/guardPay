add support for sickness day , using the law to know how to calculate them  
--- 1st day no pay , 2nd and 3rd you get 50% of your day pay , 4rd and forth you grt 100%.
--- maby in calculation the user need to enter start date and end date and in the calculation we 
check the length of the days and its acctully simple calculation from there and on.
--- need to trigger Sick days in segmentedButton that way when pressed the user only enter start date and end date.

Transforme the code to TypeScript for more type handling and robust code , will help in debugging.

-- Need to add option to let user config his own shifts hours for morning , evening and night
