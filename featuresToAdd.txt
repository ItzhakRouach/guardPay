                the first level is till 7010 he will pay 10% tax  so 701 shekel
                the seconde level 7010 - 10060 so 3050 and take from this 14% 427 shekel
                the third level  10061 to 16150 so 10061 minus 12580 = 2519 and take from this 20% so 503.8
                Total Tax = 701 + 427 + 503.8 = 1631.8 

nekudot zikoi = 2.25 = 242 * 2.25 = 544.5


------- Example of Wire frame for Overview page ----------
month : january 
bruto : 14100
regular hours : 200 = 10900
extra: hours : 22 = 3200
ride Money: 920
Bituah leumi = 14100 * 0.07 = 987
health insurance = 14100 *0.0517 = 728.97
Pensia = regular hour = 10900 * 0.07 = 763
         extra hour = 3200 * 0.07 =224
         ride = 920 * 0.05 = 46
         total = 1033

Tax = first level = 710 
      seconde level = 427 
      third level = 801.8
      total = 710 + 427 + 801.8 = 1944
      total = total - nekudot zikoi = 1944 - 544 = 1400


neto = 14100 - 987 - 728.97 -1033 - 1944 = 9,470.03
